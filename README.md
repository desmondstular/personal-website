# Personal Website
This is my personal website, which includes a web-based, bash-like terminal. It's currently a work in progress and will eventually feature a file directory and a set of basic Unix-like commands. The goal is to create an interactive terminal experience directly in the web browser, similar to a Linux shell.

## How To Access
To use this web application, clone the github repository to your local machine. After it is cloned, make sure you have node.js installed on your machine. If so, open a terminal within the project's root directory and run the following command:

`npm install`

After you have installed its dependencies, run the following command from the root directory:

`vite`

Then in your default browser, navigate to the following link to view the web app:

`http://localhost:5173/`
