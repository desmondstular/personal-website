# Personal Website
This is my personal website which is a web app like Linux terminal. It is currently still in progress.

## How To Access
To use this web application, clone the github repository to your local machine. After it is cloned, make sure you have node.js installed on your machine. If so, open a terminal within the project's root directory and run the following command:

`npm install`

After you have installed its dependencies, run the following command from the root directory:

`vite`

Then in your default browser, navigate to the following link to view the web app:
